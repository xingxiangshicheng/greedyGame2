# greedyGame2
A game concept adapted from one of the game show I've watched.

Main Idea is that everyone pools a certain amount of money and that amount will be doubled.
That pooled amount will be splitted into the total number of players and each players whether or not they pooled into the pool of money will get a fair share of it. 

Goal of the game is to have the most amount of money by the end of certain number of rounds.
